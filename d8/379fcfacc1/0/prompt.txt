how can i embed logo to readme?

---

yes, 400px width

---

maybe 200px

---

the preview broke

---

does readme overall look good?

---

i want to credit Sun-U Choe for creating the logo

---

is this enough for logo copyright?

---

i want the through approach

two suggestions from other agent:

1. The "Notice" in the License File

Most people only read the LICENSE file, not the README. If your LICENSE file is just the standard MIT text, it technically claims everything in the repo is MIT.

The Fix: Open your LICENSE file and add a note at the bottom:

    Note on Graphics: The logo (cq_logo.png) is © Sun-U Choe and is not covered by the MIT License. All rights reserved by the author.

4. Alt-Text Refinement

In your README's HTML snippet:
HTML

<img src="cq_logo.png" alt="CQ Logo" width="200">

To be extra thorough regarding the credit, you could change the alt text to alt="CQ Logo by Sun-U Choe". It’s a tiny detail, but it ensures screen readers (and search engines) associate the creator with the work.

can you modify tmp.py to do this

2. Asset Metadata (The "Invisible" Credit)

If someone forks your repo or copies the image, the README credit might get lost.

    SVG (if applicable): If cq_logo.png is an SVG, open it in a text editor and ensure there’s a <metadata> tag or a comment at the top with the copyright info.

    PNG: You can add a "Copyright" metadata tag to the file itself using standard photo editors or exiftool.

done, is it on?
